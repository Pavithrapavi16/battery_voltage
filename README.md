The circuit in the schematic uses a voltage divider network and diodes to create three threshold voltages for the comparator. the op amp compares the input voltage with the threshold voltages and generates an output signal accordingly. The output signal can be used to trigger an interrupt or activate a switch.
In "code" replace the ltspice_path and schematic_path variables with the appropriate file paths on your computer.
